# File-Securing-System-
A file system that encrypts a file and secures it with a password. Implemented in C
Encrypting the contents of a file using a user-provided keyword and password protecting the file after either generating a password or classifying a user-provided password.

The four stages are:

* Encryption using Caesar mechanism
* Password Generation
* Password Classification
* Decryption

The project can be run by compiling the files project_functions.h and project_test.c.
Intermediate files are generated which contain the encrypted form of the file.
